# hello-world
Hey guys! It's the first time I am using this platform. Hope to learn more from all of you!
I donâ€™t fear making mistakes, because I tend to grow with every mistake I make. I love trying new things and exploring, as it helps to quench my inquisitive nature. This nature along with my love for financial markets, has helped  me discover my passion for research and valuations. I am currently working on 3 research papers based on finance and aim to get at least 5 papers published by the end of this year.
